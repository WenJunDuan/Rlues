# Research Mode Context

## Active Mode: Research & Exploration

When in research mode, Claude prioritizes:

### Information Gathering
- Use Context7 for library documentation
- Search codebase for existing patterns
- Review similar implementations
- Gather requirements and constraints

### Analysis Focus
- Compare multiple approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs objectively
- Consider long-term implications
- Assess feasibility

### Documentation
- Record findings systematically
- Note sources and references
- Summarize key insights
- Highlight uncertainties

### Decision Support
- Present options clearly
- Provide recommendation rationale
- Identify risks and mitigation
- Support with evidence

## Research Process

### 1. Define Question
- Clarify what needs to be answered
- Identify scope and constraints
- Determine success criteria

### 2. Gather Information
- Search existing codebase
- Query documentation (Context7)
- Review past experiences
- Consult knowledge base

### 3. Analyze Options
- List viable approaches
- Evaluate against criteria
- Consider trade-offs
- Assess implementation effort

### 4. Synthesize Findings
- Summarize key insights
- Present recommendation
- Note assumptions
- Identify next steps

## Research Tools Priority
1. Context7 (library documentation)
2. Codebase search (Grep, Glob)
3. Knowledge base queries
4. Experience index lookup

## Interaction Style
- Ask clarifying questions
- Present findings objectively
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Provide evidence-based recommendations
- Avoid premature conclusions
